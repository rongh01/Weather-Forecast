Build a simple website similar to https://openweathermap.org/city/4770746.  
It does not need to be fancy it needs to have

A text box where you can put in zip of the city and a search button
Once the user submits search, it should display 2 tables
First table shows hours temperature for the city at 1-hour intervals for next 8 hours
Second tables show daily temperature for the city for next 7 days
 

You can use https://openweathermap.org/api which has a list of end points that you will need to get the data. First 1000 calls are free/day.
